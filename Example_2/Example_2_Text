Problem 5 (LogicMin): Simplify the expression (A AND B AND C) OR (A AND NOT B AND NOT C)
Explanation: This problem uses LogicMin to minimize a more complex Boolean expression involving three variables (A, B, C). LogicMin is used to determine the simplest form of the given expression.

Problem 6 (LogicMin): Simplify the expression (A OR B) AND (NOT C OR D)
Explanation: This problem uses LogicMin to simplify a Boolean expression with four inputs (A, B, C, D).
The expression involves both AND and OR operations. LogicMin helps in finding a more efficient representation of the expression.

Problem 7 (SymPy): Simplify the expression (A AND (B OR C)) OR (NOT A AND (B AND NOT C))
Explanation: This problem uses SymPy to simplify a complex Boolean expression involving multiple logical operations (AND, OR, NOT).
The simplify() function is used to reduce the complexity of the expression, making it easier to understand or implement.

Problem 8 (SymPy): Create a truth table for the expression (A OR B) AND (C OR D)
Explanation: This problem uses SymPy to generate a truth table for the Boolean expression involving four variables (A, B, C, D).
The truth table displays all possible combinations of input values and their corresponding output, which helps to visualize the logic of the expression comprehensively.
