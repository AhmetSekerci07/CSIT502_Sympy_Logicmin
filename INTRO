SymPy:

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics that allows us to solve mathematical expressions symbolically.
It is used for symbolic logic operations.
The symbols function in this library is used to define symbolic variables (e.g., A, B, C).
We can use functions like And, Or, and Not to define logical expressions. These functions represent logical operations: AND, OR, and NOT.
The simplify function is used to simplify logical expressions.
The truth_table function creates a truth table for a given logical expression.


LogicMin:

LogicMin is used for minimizing logical circuits and creating truth tables.
The logicmin.TT class is used to create a truth table. This class allows us to specify the number of inputs and outputs (e.g., TT(2, 1) creates a truth table with 2 inputs and 1 output).
To add different input-output combinations to the table, we use the add function.
The solve function is used to minimize the expression defined by the truth table.
In summary:

SymPy is used for symbolic logic operations and simplifying expressions. Functions like And, Or, and Not allow for symbolic operations.
LogicMin is mainly used to create truth tables and minimize the expressions derived from these tables.
